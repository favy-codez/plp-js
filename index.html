    <h2>Final Exercise: Build a Cash Register Machine</h2>
    <h5>
      Let's build a cash register machine that can add items to a shopping cart,
      calculate total price, calculate discounts, and accept payment by cash.
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The currency is assumed in USD, so you don't need to add it to the
        program. The cash register has 3 items for sale: Phone for 300 Smart TV
        for 220 Gaming Console for 150
      </li>
      <li>
        There's a 10% discount when the total price is higher than 400. The cash
        register should have a shopping cart that starts empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cash register should provide a method called addItem that takes the
        name of an item as a parameter. When called, it should check if the item
        is available for sale.
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is, the item should be added to the shopping cart. If it is not
        available, show a message saying we don't sell that item.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cash register should provide a method called calculateTotalPrice
        that calculates the total price of all the items in the shopping cart.
      </li>
      <li>
        It should iterate over the items in the shopping cart and sum up their
        prices.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cash register should provide a method called pay that takes the
        payment amount as a parameter. It should calculate the total price of
        the items in the shopping cart using the calculateTotalPrice method.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the total price is higher than 400, a 10% discount should be applied.
      </li>
      <li>
        The method should then compare the payment amount with the total price
        (after applying the discount) and display an appropriate message: If the
        payment amount is equal to or greater than the total price, it should
        display a message thanking the customer for the purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is any change, it should also display the amount of change to
        be given. If the payment amount is less than the total price, it should
        display a message indicating that the customer does not have enough
        money to purchase the items.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program should include appropriate console.log() statements to
        display messages for adding items to the shopping cart, displaying the
        total price, and processing the payment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program should handle scenarios where the customer's payment amount
        is exactly equal to the total price, as well as cases where the payment
        amount is greater or less than the total price.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To build the program, you need to use what you've learned about objects,
      arrays, conditionals, and loops.
